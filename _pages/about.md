Hi! I am a Computer Vision Data Scientist at Bayer AG. I specialize in applying artificial intelligence and image analysis techniques to various medical applications, with the goal of developing solutions that assist clinicians in their daily practice.

I was a BSc/MSc Biomedical Engineering student at [Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/) in Lisbon, Portugal from 2017 to 2023. The nature of my studies allowed me to build core engineering skills while also developping my clinical and medical knoweledge with base medical courses. During my MSc I specialised in Medical Imaging and Biosignal Processing and Acquisition, having the chance to deepen my knoweledge in medical AI applications during my exchange semester in [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/) in 2021.

From 2022 to 2023, I completed two different contracts at Bayer AG (Berlin, Germany) working first as an Intern and then as a Working Student focused on developping deep generative models for radiological and digital pathology data, yielding a [publication](https://www.mdpi.com/2075-4418/14/13/1442) at MDPI Diagnostics. In parallel, I also worked on my master thesis project at [Institute for Systems and Robotics] (https://welcome.isr.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/), focused on developping an deep-learning framework for automating the time-consuming cardiac MRI view planning process. I was fortunate to be able to present this work in poster format at [2023 ISMRM & ISMRT Annual Meeting and Exhibition](https://www.ismrm.org/23m/) in Toronto, Canada.

Since late 2023, I have been extending my work in Synthetic Medical Image data ([paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11594)) still at Bayer AG, but as full time as a Computer Vision Data Scientist based in Barcelona, Spain. My research interests include: Synthetic Data Augmentation, Medical Image Inpainting, Counter-factual Generation, Visual-Language Modelling. Expanding beyond the medical image domain, I am interested in machine learning applications for drug discovery.
